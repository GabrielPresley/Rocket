This controller was built out of a CPVC electrical box of dimensions:    
110x110mm    
This box has a single    
26.75mm ID    
wiring hole.   

NOTE: internal batteries may be tweaked to fit the design requiremnents of your project. As an example, I am likely to switch the internal batteries to three or four 9 volt batteries (two 3 in series, or 2x2)
